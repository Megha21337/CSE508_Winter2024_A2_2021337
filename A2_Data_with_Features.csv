They're gentle on the instruments, and the grippy material keeps them secure.

The greatest benefit has been when writing music at the computer and needing to set a guitar down to use the keyboard/mouse - just easier for me than a hanging stand.

The guitar both looks and feels great. The finish is very well done. It's got a warm and full sound to it that I really enjoyed, that at times I found myself reluctant to stop playing. And I was really pleased with how smooth the fretting was, it felt like it took less effort to move between the frets and press down than on several guitars I've played on previously.

The only gripe I have is that the fret position markers (dots) are really dark and hard to spot (see pictures). But that's not a deal breaker by any means, since when playing you would normally look at the markers on the side of the neck, which were pretty clear. Still, aesthetically the dark markers don't look as nice.

But overall I was quite impressed, especially for such a great price.

The case appears to be built well, however, the case lid is misaligned with the base section when closed shut. The lid should overlap the bottom case similar to how a shoe box lid fits on top of its box. The misalignment creates an odd gap which is only noticeable upon close inspection. I have a similar Epiphone case for my Sheraton and that case closes properly like my shoe box example. So beware production quality may not be consistant and could vary on a case to case basis (I couldn't resist that pun).

Also, I feel my guitar should fit more snugly inside the case similar to how my Gretsch G5120 Electromatic fits inside its Gretsch G6241FT Flat Top case. My Gretsch G5120 has a snug (almost tight) fit inside its G6241FT case which allows absolutely no wiggle room.

Aside from the two aforementioned complaints, I am generally satisfied with the Epiphone case.

I have installed these strings on two of my basses and I find them to be most excellent for my needs.  For one thing, these kind of strings are not ""fret eaters"" due to their flatwound smooth surface.  Also, they are lots easier on your fingers if you should play that way.  The various tones and behaviors that these strings produce is hard to describe, but it is a situation that very much agrees with me.  You almost have to hear them to really know.  I just got done installing a set of these DR's on a Reverend Thundergun 4 string bass and they sound awesome.  It might be noted that this bass has a 34"" scale neck and string through bridge.  I had no problems with installation or in tuning.  I am pretty much committed to these style of bass strings.  However a word of caution here.  These strings are not supposed to fit long scaled necks.

This Donner Capo has held up the longest of any Capo I have purchased him and it's still working. The clamping mechanism is strong and has not popped apart like all of our previous Capo's.

I do not play guitar, however my son and husband tell me this is a very well made Capo and that it does exactly what it's supposed to do.

The padding on the bag is good. I would definitely say it is about average for a gig bag.  The padding about an inch thick and is better than the really cheap gig bags.

I replaced the heads with these and was rewarded with an amazing difference in sound quality. The ringing, hollow quality I previously struggled to correct is now a nice ""thump"" sound that works perfectly with jazz and rock.

In addition to this head I upgraded to the 10"" (ASIN: B0002E1FQW) on my other mounted tom and the 14"" (ASIN: B0002D0DSO) on my floor tom.  The results were so dramatic that I also upgraded the batter side head on my bass drum with the 20"" bass drum head (ASIN: B0002D0E3S).

In addition to achieving the exact sound I wanted I also get far better stick response, and have found that tuning these heads are far easier than any other head I've used, including Remo that I use on my Ludwig kit.

UPDATE: I've had the cymbal for about 1.5 years, and it's cracked to the point where I can't play it anymore.

Somehow I missed that line before purchasing. These will fit nicely on an SM-58 or other handheld mic with a ball-type grill. They will slide right off an SM-57 or similar shaped mic. That's not a defect, just something you want to know. But at ~$2.00 for a five-pack, I have zero complaints.

And they WILL work on a straight shaped mic with the aid of a hair-tie, rubber band, gaff tape, etc. For size reference, see pic. I have the blue one on an SM-57. I even managed to get the yellow one to stretch over a Sennheiser e609 (this is of questionable usefulness, since it's pretty much exclusively an instrumental mic, but I figured I'd see if I could).

It kept falling over. This mic stand was sold to hold the darn thing but it only works if you place the Isolation Shield in a certain direction (see picture). You must remove the rubber pads that are on the Microphone shield, if you don't you'll find your Isolation shield on the floor! The weight is too heavy for the rubber pads to hold them up (they are glued on). So you have to tighten metal to metal to hold the shield in place. You have to constantly check the tightening supports to make sure they don't pull the support stand down with it! You also have to remove the bottom metal desk supports from the Mic Shield to lighten the load on the Mic Stand.

I installed on my 16 x 16 inch Pearl Session floor tom conversion and attached an Audix D6--a rather substantial kick drum mic that is hangs pretty heavy toward the front. I got a little creative with the install, attaching all eight leather straps around the circumference of the drum and weaving the rubber cord (full length) back and forth around the Shu (see photos). I used the May no-drill vent hole mic cable adapter to wire it up. I'm very pleased with the design and quality of the Kelly Shu.

I found a way to make the iKlip super useful. When detached from my instrument stand, the clamp assembly serves as a highly stable, adjustable kick stand.

Mounted on a mic or guitar stand, It is quite adjustable, and a channel in the socket adjustment lets the arm point all the way to the floor.

The clip holds the iPad so snugly that I would trust it in portrait mode even though the clips would be holding your device from the sides.

The sound has been kind of a blanket statement of ""transparent light to medium drive"".

It's definitely a smoother overdrive than other Tube Screamers or clones I have.

The pedal I'd compare this to the most would be the Ibanez TS808, obviously. The sounds of the 2 pedals are very similar, but the OD808 is a little smaller, has a normal stompswitch, and costs a little less than the TS808 Reissue.

I was getting tired of always packing them in their individual cases. It's very well-made with really good quality zippers and construction, with roomy front and side pouches I haven't even used yet. :) The bag comes with 10 dividers (I only used 8...description says it comes with 8, but I'm pretty sure I got 10) which can be repositioned with velcro (probably much neater than I've done here).

To be fair, this is a softside padded case, so I won't be throwing it around like a stevedore, but the quick-draw action makes it fast and easy to pull the lights for set up. And packing is faster, too.

This bag is so well-constructed, I'm sure I'll be using it for years to come.

This strap is only 3/8"" inch wide, but my ukulele is so lightweight that I really don't need anything wider and a narrower strap doesn't get in the way of my arms and hands. Installing this strap without removing my ukulele strings took some effort. I had to unthread the strap loop (which is really much tighter than it needs to be), then thread the strap end under my ukulele strings, then thread it back through the strap loop (which is still much tighter than it needs to be). The plastic buckle in the middle of the strap is not removable, so you need to thread that through strap loop and it is a real tight fit. Once installed, the strap works great.

I believe Kolstein includes wax in their rosin recipe, which keeps dust from forming. The other benefit of Kolstein is that it lasts for a very long time on the shelf. Pop's will dry out in less than 2 years. Some people will only use Pop's for a few months before throwing it away. I go back and forth between Kolstein and Pop's.

I do wish they chose to use a heavier duty zipper, but this one has done OK so far (almost a year old)

Modification Details (see pics)
Purchase 1/8"" particle board from hardware store ($4.99)
Use Exacto knife to remove flimzy foam from bottom of gig bag
Use the foam as template to cut the particle board
Slide the cut board in
Use glue gun to seal
Optional, use the removed foam from bottom to strengthen the top of the bag by slicing it and adding it.

You now have a much more durable board, AND retained all of the usable velcro

I listened to some dubstep tracks while using this and I couldn't believe how accurate it was! The lights alternated between each color during the climb, and flashed in a unison strobe at the drop!

So why is this getting a 3 star review? After a week of use, three out of the four strips of blue circle lights just stopped working. Everything else works just fine after months of use, but most of the blue lights are missing. I would have returned it if the vendor I bought it for didn't charge $10 shipping and $15 restocking. However most people here don't seem to have this problem, so I would say it's worth the risk of purchase.

I'm sure I'm correct in my assumption that these inexpensive tuners are mass-produced in China and receive all manner of brand name logos on them.

Also, due to package being labeled ""Lithium Battery Enclosed"", this Amazon Prime item took 7 full days to arrive... Not the usual 2-day Prime shipping.

Aside from these two issues, this $9 tuner seems to work as well as my $20 Korg TM50BK.
I purchased it because the price was so low that I thought it couldn't hurt to have an extra tuner lying about the studio.
I plan to order another to donate to our church's music dept.

For those interested, this tuner w/included clip-on mic does indeed fit in the same co2CREA case made for the Korg TM50BK tuner:

But the best feature in my opinion is that the tuner turns green when you are perfectly in tune!
I am someone who plays with the guitar more than plays it and although I have a good ear, I feel the need to double check to see that I have tuned my guitar correctly.
I checked the tuning against a more expensive tuner that my friend owns and I can testify that this little tuner is extremely accurate.

My Session kit came with them and with the heavy 6 play maple toms have never had a single issue with tuning, bouncing, lug stress whatsoever.  I think after you use them for a while you can take them for granted and don't fully understand how sturdy they are until you use another suspension system.  I recently purchased a Pearl Birch Vision kit for my wife which came with Pearl's I.S.S. mounting system.  To be fair I've never used them, and in the case of the new kit they came right off, and the Optimounts went right on.  Even though these are not the aluminum (more expensive and slightly lighter) Masterworks version, I feel they not only work for what they're intended, but they also accent the drum shells without being intrusive.

These are kinda like that, but a little thicker and shaped into blue rectangles that are approximately 1"" x 2"".

you can stick them to any part of your drum head to dampen sound as needed. They even work on cymbals if you're looking for a quicker decay!

The closer to the center (or more pads you use), the more dramatic the effect. You can also cut them to get more pieces out of them if needed. If you drop them or they end up getting too dirty to stick to anything, you can wash them in the sink with dish soap and air dry them.

They sound awesome with lots of punch and, they stay clean on the low notes. Im impressed with em.
The down side would be:
1. The covers are not connected to the pickups and, the adjustment springs support the covers. So, you need to glue the covers on so the weight of the pickup doesn't pull loose and fall into the cavity over time. I used clear epoxy and, hoping for the best since I sold the bass when it was finished. On a positive note, the screws and springs were included which was very nice.
2. The covers have sharper corners than standard precision bass pickups so, if you use a template to route cavities,  you'll probably have to go back and chisel the corners like I did.
Im not a fan of that since it doesn't look as professional but, I was using a chrome pickup cover so, it worked out.

My pedal is 21 1/8"" and fits fine.

One minor complaint I have is that the shoulder strap adjustment buckle prevents you from placing the pad in the middle of the strap if you tighten the strap from just before medium to ""tightened all the way.""  This is not a big deal to me, because I can sew/create a better strap system.
